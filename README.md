# 6.824_Lab_2022
MIT 6.824 2022 Lab implemented by Qing Feng

The 6.824 website: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/
Through the whole semester I have looked at multiple references on zhihu.com but have implemented all code independently.
For lab1 mapreduce and lab4 sharded kv I came up with new design but left corresponding challenges alone. For lab4 I implemented two-phase commit for sharded groups that all groups agree on the same config although finer granularity is prefered to tackle the challenges.
